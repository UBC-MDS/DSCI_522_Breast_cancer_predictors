# DSCI_522_Breast_cancer_predictors
Decision tree analysis of breast cancer result metrics to deduce the strongest predictor of malignancy
By: Arzan Irani and Milos Milic


##Introduction
We wanted to find an interesting data set where we can apply some of the newest methods we have learned in DSCI 571. As we want to see if we can apply a decision tree to a data source to see if we can build a decision tree around our training data set. We may also ply with the process of using only a portion of the set for the training data and once we have our deciders to apply it to our test data set. 

##Data Source

The data source we used was the the Wiscoincon Breast Cancer result data. The link to the data source is here. The set is a collection of 393 benign and 212 malignant fine needle aspirate samples of a breast mass. Each digitised sample has 30 features associated with it.

##Objective/Question

The question we asked ourselves is that based on this data set, are any of the 30 features captured in each of the smear samples indicative of breast cancer? Are there any trends we can define in regards to defining whether a sample is positive or negative for breast cancer?

##Process to Analyse

I am not sure what to write here


##Type of Analysis

The type of analysis we will be running is a decision tree and we want to find what are the top 5 deciders in regard to the Breast cancer sample being benign or malignant.

##How to report results

We will plot a decision tree and see if we can show the 5 factors from our analysis as well as the stump
